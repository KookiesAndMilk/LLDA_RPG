##   LLDA_RPG
This is an RPG made with Python using, esentially, the Pygame library. It is about our uni and friends from there.

# How to start?
You can simply download the .zip file from the GitHub repository, go to the "main.py" file and click on the run button.

As of today, december 5th, 2024, we haven't done a lot about gameplay, you can still leave your comments and give us feedback though.
Be aware that we are 3rd semester students and are doing our bests to make our first ever RPG in Python.
